# Linux Shell

This **Linux Shell** is a custom implementation of a command-line interface shell built for Unix-like operating systems. It replicates the functionality of a standard Linux shell, allowing users to execute system commands, manage processes, and explore basic scripting capabilities.

This project is done as a personnal project in my free time.
